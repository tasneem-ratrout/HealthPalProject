🌟 About the Project – HealthPal API

HealthPal is a comprehensive healthcare backend API designed to support the Palestinian medical ecosystem by connecting patients, doctors, NGOs, volunteers, and donors through one unified digital platform.
The system provides essential healthcare services such as appointment booking, medical history tracking, medical missions, donations, support groups, health alerts, and more — all secured and managed through a scalable RESTful API.

This project empowers communities with reliable access to healthcare resources, improves communication between medical actors, and enables NGOs and donors to efficiently provide support during crises and daily medical needs.
